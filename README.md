# Astro 497 Lab 7
## Queries & Data Wrangling

## Exercise 1:  Queries & Data Wrangling
- Work through ex1.jl (a Pluto notebook) on querying databases and using 


## Exercise 2:  Using Astroquery to access astronomical data
- Work through ex2.jl (a Pluto notebook)

## Exercise 3 (Optional):  Using a custom python package to access astronomical data 
- Work through ex3.jl (a Pluto notebook)

All students should work through ex1.jl.  
Students may choose to complete either exercise 2 or exercise 3, depending on what would be most useful for their class project.  

## Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Write queries using ADQL and TAP
- Access tables with results of queries
- Wrange data in DataFrames using select, filter, join, groupby & transform
- Crossmatch objects between two catalogs
- Download datafiles from a major astronomical archives via astroquery (in ex2.jl)
- Access data from FITS files (in ex2.jl)
- Perform Box-Least Squares (BLS) periodogram (in ex3.jl)
- Apply low-pass filter to light curve (in ex3.jl)

Students will strengthen their understanding of:
- Rossiter-McLaughlin observations
- Data products avaliable from space-based photometric missions (in either ex2.jl or ex3.jl)
- Pre-processing of photometric time series (in ex3.jl)
- Combining multiple programmling languages (in either ex2.jl or ex3.jl)

## Logistics
Follow the link provided via Canvas to create your own private copy of this lab's repository on GitHub.com.   
Before starting ex2.jl or ex3.jl, see instructions in Canvas announcement for updating your Julia depot, so the calls to astropy, astroquery and lightkurve will work.  
See the
[help on the course website](https://psuastro497.github.io/fall2022/resources/labs/) for instructions on cloning, commiting, pushing and submiting your work.
