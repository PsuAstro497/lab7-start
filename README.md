# Astro 497 Lab 7
## Queries & Data Wrangling

## Exercise 1:  Queries & Data Wrangling
- Work through ex1.jl (a Pluto notebook) on querying databases and using 

## Exercise 2:  Using Astroquery to access astronomical data
- Work through ex2.jl (a Pluto notebook)

## Exercise 3 (Optional):  Using a custom python package to access astronomical data 
- Work through ex3.jl (a Pluto notebook)

## Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Write queries using ADQL and TAP
- Access tables with results of queries
- Wrange data in DataFrames using select, filter, join, groupby & transform
- Download datafiles from a major astronomical archives via astroquery
- Access data from FITS files
- Perform Box-Least Squares (BLS) periodogram
- Call functions from python packages in Julia
- Apply low-pass filter to light curve (optional)

Students will strengthen their understanding of:
- Rossiter-McLaughlin observations
- Pre-processing of photometric time series to identify transiting planet candidates
- Working with multiple languages
